    /// • Pixel-art sprite weather for rain/storm/snow/hail/sand plus CpuParticles2D leaves.
    /// • Ambient lighting via CanvasModulate (dark for storms, warm for heatwave, etc.).
    /// • Lightning flashes: random full-screen ColorRect brightness bursts during Storm.
    /// • Wind force (Vector2) that gameplay components can read for leaf-drift, projectile drift, etc.
    /// • AutoCycle mode: rotates through weather types on a configurable timer.
    /// • Smooth ambient-color transitions (tween) when switching weather.

    /// no player could ever open. They had no inbound edge at all — nothing instanced them,
    /// no menu listed them, and nav_wiring couldn't name them because GameInfo's scene-path
    /// properties only covered platformer/shooter/puzzle. The generator faithfully copied
    /// them into every project as unreachable files.
    ///
    /// The path half is fixed by GameInfo.GenreScenePaths (any nav_wiring key resolves); this
    /// is the other half — something that actually opens them.
    ///
    /// Overlay, never ChangeScene: these sit over a running game. Navigating to an inventory
    /// would free the run behind it — the same hazard SettingsOverlay exists to avoid, and
    /// the one LevelUpChoice shipped with. Closing is the screen's own job (QueueFree).

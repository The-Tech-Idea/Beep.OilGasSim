    /// "**Segmented progress is the default, continuous is the exception**" is one of the art
    /// pass's settled rules, measured across seven independent references (gameui1-4, rpg1, rpg2,
    /// rpgui1). Every meter this framework shipped before was a continuous bar, which is the
    /// exception being used as the rule.
    ///
    /// Two more settled rules are built in rather than left to the caller:
    ///  - "**Empty/track = a dark tint of the surface's own HUE, never grey**" (4 references).
    ///    A grey track is the single clearest tell of a themed form; the track must carry the
    ///    same hue as the fill so the meter reads as one object.
    ///  - "**The palette goes on ONE element**, the other stays neutral" (5 references) — so the
    ///    fill takes the role colour and the track is derived from it, not separately themed.
    ///
    /// The optional end CAP comes from gameui6 and rpgui.md's finding that on that sheet
    /// "variation lives in the END CAPS, not the body — six bars, one track". The cap is a
    /// KitAttach so it can overhang the bar, which is how every reference draws it.
